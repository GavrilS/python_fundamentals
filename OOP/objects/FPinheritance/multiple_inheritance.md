# Multiple inheritance poses a problem known as the diamond problem -> if you have a class that inherits from multiple classes that have a method with the same signature, how does the subclass decide which super method to execute. In python this is resolved with the MRO - Method Resolution Order. Basically, each class has a __mro__ attribute, that holds a tuple of references to the specific class parents. The MRO can be bypassed and you can invoke the super method on a specific class by calling it directly, but relying on the MRO is more secure and error prone. The class signature is important for multiple inheritance as the order in which you put the super classes in the signature determines their order when resolving a super call.
