# We can have else blocks with:

- if statements -> if (condition is true): do something; else: do something else

- for statements -> the else block will run only if and when the for loop runs to completion

- while statements -> the else block will run only if and when the while loop exits because the cond. became
  falsy

- try statements -> the else block will run only if no exception is raised in the try block
