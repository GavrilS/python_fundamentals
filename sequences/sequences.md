# Built in sequences:
- Container sequences - list, tuple, collections.deque can hold items of different types; hold references to the objects they contain
- Flat sequences - str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, array.array hold items of one type; physically store the value of each item

# Grouping sequences by mutability:
- Mutable sequences: list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque, memoryview
- Immutable sequences: tuple, str, bytes
