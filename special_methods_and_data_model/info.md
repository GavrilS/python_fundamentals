Dunder or special(magic) methods are methods that are called by python under specific conditions(they are called implicitly by the language).

- __init__ is used to initialize a class instance

Python operators like '+', '==' and 'in' rely on dunder methods to implement their behaviour. The 'in' method for example uses the dunder method '__contains__'.
